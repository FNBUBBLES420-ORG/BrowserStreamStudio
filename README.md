#### FFmpeg Installation
- 🪟 **Windows Users:**
   1. [Download FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and extract the ZIP file.
   2. Copy the `bin` folder path (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`).
   3. Press <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>, type `sysdm.cpl`, and press Enter.
   4. Go to the **Advanced** tab and click **Environment Variables**.
   5. Under **System variables**, select `Path` and click **Edit**.
   6. Click **New** and paste the `bin` folder path. Click **OK** to save.
   7. Open a new terminal and run `ffmpeg -version` to check it works.
- 🍏 **Mac Users:**

     cd ../frontend && npm install
     cd ../../main && npm install
     ```

3️⃣ **Set Up Streaming Accounts** *(Optional, but recommended)*
   - 📝 Open `main/backend/.env` in a text editor
   - 🔑 Add your Twitch, YouTube, and Kick client IDs/secrets (see the wiki or ask for help if unsure)
   - 🌐 Set `RTMP_URL` to your stream server (for Twitch, see your dashboard for the right URL)
---

- >💡 **Tip for Windows Users:**
To open a terminal in the correct folder easily, open your project folder in File Explorer, click the URL bar, type `cmd`, and press Enter. This will open Command Prompt in the right location. Then just run the app as described below!

## 4️⃣ **Run the App**
   - In the app folder, open a terminal or command prompt and run:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - ⏳ Wait a few moments. The app will automatically open in a desktop window (Electron). If it doesn't, check your terminal for errors.
   - 🌍 You can also open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the app in your browser.
   - ⚠️ **Leave the terminal open while using the app!** Closing it will stop the app.
   - 🛠️ For more advanced options (like running backend/frontend/Electron separately), see the "For Developers" section below.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! To make BrowserStream Studio better:

### How to Contribute
1. **Fork the repo and clone your fork**
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix
3. **Make your changes** (see code structure below)
4. **Test locally** (see Quick Start above)
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Code Structure
- `main/frontend/` — React (Vite, TypeScript, MUI) UI
- `main/backend/` — Node.js/Express backend, plugin sandbox, OAuth, ffmpeg
- `main/` — Electron main process
- `db.json` — Local user/plugin data (auto-created)

### Guidelines
- Keep security in mind: sanitize all user input, never run untrusted code outside the plugin sandbox
- Write clear, user-friendly UI/UX
- Test your changes before submitting
- Document new features in this README

---

## 🔒 Security
- All user data and plugins are stored locally
- Plugins run in a Node.js VM sandbox with no access to the system
- Input/output is sanitized throughout
- Sessions, rate limiting, and CORS are enabled by default

---

## 📢 Feedback & Support
- Found a bug? Open an issue or pull request

Happy streaming and hacking!

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- (Optional) Yarn if you prefer
- (Optional) Git for version control

## Install Dependencies

From the project root:


```
npm install
cd main/backend
npm install
cd ../frontend
npm install
cd ../../main
npm install
```

## Environment Variables

Edit `backend/.env` and set your Twitch, YouTube, and Kick client IDs and secrets.

## Development


### Option 1: Manual (Recommended for Debugging)
1. **Start Backend:**
   ```
   cd main/backend
   npm run dev
   ```
2. **Start Frontend (in a new terminal):**
   ```
   cd main/frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   > ⚠️ **Leave this terminal running!** The Electron app needs the frontend dev server to be running at http://localhost:3000.
3. **Start Electron App (in another terminal, from project root):**
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   > Electron will open and load the running frontend. If you see a blank window, make sure the frontend dev server is running.

### Option 2: All-in-One (Quick Start)
From the project root, run:
```
npm run dev
```
This will start the backend, frontend, and Electron app together (using concurrently). Useful for quick development, but you may need to scroll up to see all logs.

## User Interface

- The app now includes a user-friendly Settings page for adjusting stream settings (bitrate, resolution, output) and managing account connections (Twitch, YouTube, Kick).
- Access the Settings page from the Home screen or via the /settings route.

- The backend runs on http://localhost:4000
- The frontend runs on http://localhost:3000
- Electron loads the frontend and connects to the backend

## Usage Notes
- Local storage is per user (per machine)
- Plugins and user data are stored locally
- OAuth for Twitch, YouTube, and Kick is set up for local development
- Security and sanitization are enabled by default

## Next Steps
- Implement streaming controls and plugin logic
- Write a full end-user README.md before release
